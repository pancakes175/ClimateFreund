El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is well known for being the most important climate driver at interannual time scale, but what about the low frequency variations? In this project, climate reconstructions of ENSO are compared with forced & unforced climate model simulations over the past millennium. Can we see evidence of changes of solar activity or volcanism in ENSO reconstructions and possibly even parallels in climate model simulations? How skilful are these long simulations in representing low and high frequency?
