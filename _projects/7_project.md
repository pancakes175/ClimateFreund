Earth’s average global surface temperature is determined by the balance between incoming and outgoing radiation.  While anthropogenic climate change alters the energy budget at long time scales, El Niño Southern Oscillation events can cause temporary fluctuations. With increasing complexity of ENSO events in terms of temporal and spatial behavior, the impact of diverse ENSO events on global mean surface temperatures is not yet clear. This project can utilise a diverse range of climate model simulations, observations or even paleo evidence to assess the impact events like El Niño and La Niña events on our climate.
