The development of an La Niña event is on the caps to be decided. For Australia, La Niña is often associated with increased rainfall, which can significantly impact agriculture and water resources. The uncertainty surrounding this event means that planning ahead becomes both essential and challenging. Recently, the Bureau of Meteorology, keeping a close eye on the latest observations and modelling results, has raised its ENSO outlook to a La Niña watch, indicating a 50% chance that La Niña could develop in the coming months. However, many are wondering why this La Niña signal is emerging so late. Typically, signs of ENSO events are observed earlier in the year, giving scientists and decision-makers more time to prepare for the associated impacts.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="la-nina-could-be-declared-this-summer">La Nina could be declared this summer</h2> <p>ENSO events have a well-documented history of triggering devastating global natural disasters. The 2015-16 El Niño, for example, affected nearly 60 million people across Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, and the Asia-Pacific, leading to widespread droughts, floods, food insecurity, disease outbreaks, malnutrition, and respiratory issues. Following the rare “triple-dip” La Niña from 2020-2023, Australia is bracing for the potential impacts of yet another La Niña event. The looming threat brings concerns of heavy rainfall and heightened flooding risks across the country. Should La Niña be declared in 2024, it would mark the fourth ENSO event in just five years—an unusually active period for ENSO, though not without historical precedent. As Australia watches closely, the possible arrival of La Niña adds urgency to preparing for what could be another season of extreme weather.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="late-prediction-of-enso-events--harder-to-predict">Late prediction of ENSO events- harder to predict?</h2> <p>Predicting ENSO events like El Niño and La Niña has always been tricky. These events follow the seasonal cycle, usually developing in autumn, peaking in late spring or summer, and weakening by the next autumn. However, predictions are hardest during the Southern Hemisphere’s autumn, a period known as the ‘predictability barrier,’ when forecasting accuracy drops significantly. This year, we’ve reached late spring without a clear declaration of La Niña. Why the delay? The Bureau of Meteorology points to climate change as a factor. Oceans have absorbed much of the excess heat from global warming, and warmer waters are being observed globally. This makes it harder to spot the specific warming patterns linked to La Niña, which usually causes wetter conditions in Australia. The complexity of the ocean-atmosphere system adds to the difficulty. Even with improved prediction models, understanding ENSO still requires better data on deep ocean processes and how winds affect the system. Global warming may also be changing how often and how intensely these events occur.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="more-precise-and-earlier-el-niño-southern-oscillation-forecasts">More precise and earlier El Niño Southern Oscillation forecasts</h2> <p>A new study published in Environmental Research Letters has assessed the likelihood of different types of ENSO events—either in the Eastern or Central Pacific—occurring in succession.

However, La Niña behaves differently. There’s a 40% chance that a Central Pacific El Niño could follow an Eastern Pacific La Niña, and a 27.8% chance of two consecutive Central Pacific La Niña events.</p> <p>“Australia recently experienced a strong Eastern Pacific El Niño starting in September 2023,” said Dr. Freund. “Our findings suggest only a 16.7% chance of La Niña developing in 2024, and if it does, it will likely peak in the Central Pacific.”</p> <p>As climate change accelerates, the frequency, types, and transitions of ENSO events are expected to shift, with fewer calm, neutral years between events.
