# Semester 1: Atmospheric processes and composition

Atmospheric Processes and Composition (Course Coordinator)

[3rd year Undergraduate ATOC30008]

School of Geography, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, University of Melbourne

Semester 1 - 2026

### Overview
This subject presents a comprehensive view of the processes that are responsible for the structure, composition and properties of the atmosphere. It will focus on local and regional scales, covering aerosol and cloud processes such as formation, precipitation and lightning. It will address how these atmospheric processes and composition interact with the climate system - discussing major weather systems, land use, air quality and greenhouse gas fluxes. This subject will involve a face-to-face or virtual field trip to the Creswick campus in week 5 of semester to observe the atmospheric boundary layer state and chemical composition using state of the art monitoring equipment.

### Intended learning outcomes
On successful completion of this subject, students should be able to:
* Describe the thermal structure of the atmosphere using the fundamental principles of thermodynamics, surface energy fluxes and cloud microphysics
* Use these principles to explain regional scale meteorological processes such as clouds, precipitation, stability and boundary layer behaviour including air pollution
* Assess the dependence and influence of these processes on external factors such as larger scale weather systems, local land use, coastlines and topography
* Describe and implement observational techniques for measuring the atmospheric state and composition
* Present implications of observed atmospheric conditions and composition as written technical reports
* Implement appropriate numerical methods and write computer code to analyse and understand real-world atmospheric data.

### Generic skills
Students can expect to gain generic skills in:
* demonstrate a high level of achievement in writing and problem-solving;
* apply analytical, quantitative and technical skills to problem solving;
* critically analyse information as life-long learners;
* demonstrate excellent organisational, planning and time management skills; and
* apply scientific knowledge to understand technological and social changes.

# Semester 2: Wonders of the weather 

Wonders of the weather (Course Coordinator)

[1st year Undergraduate ATOC1001]

School of Geography, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, University of Melbourne

Semester 2 - 2026

### Overview
The weather controls the quality of the air we breathe, the water we drink and the food we eat. The atmosphere and oceans influence decisions about what we wear, how we travel, where we live and how we spend our weekends and holidays. This subject explores how the atmosphere and oceans determine many aspects of our lives. Questions such as what controls when and where it rains, the surf on a beach, ocean currents, seasonal snowfalls, and tropical cyclones will be explored. How the weather controls flooding and bushfire danger and why it is essential for water, energy and food security are discussed. Our health (heart attacks, allergies, respiratory and psychological wellbeing) is correlated with weather events. This subject will provide an introduction to understanding the weather and weather forecasting tools so important for the world we live in.

### Intended learning outcomes
On completion of this subject, students will have learnt to:
* reflect as active global citizens sensitively and sustainably about how weather affects our environment, food, water and energy resources
* describe the atmospheric and ocean structure and how it influences weather and climate of the Earth system
* interpret weather maps and weather forecasts
* explain atmospheric phenomena such as urban air pollution and extreme weather events such as heat waves and cyclones

### Generic skills
Students can expect to gain generic skills in:
* demonstrate a high level of achievement in writing
* reflect and critique information as life-long learners
* demonstrate excellent organisational, planning and time management skills
* apply knowledge and attitude to adapt to technological and social changes
* examine critically and evaluate knowledge across a range of disciplines
