Semester 2: Wonders of the weather 

Wonders of the weather (Course Coordinator)
[1st year Undergraduate ATOC1001]
School of Geography, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, University of Melbourne
Semester 2
2024

## Overview
The weather controls the quality of the air we breathe, the water we drink and the food we eat. The atmosphere and oceans influence decisions about what we wear, how we travel, where we live and how we spend our weekends and holidays. This subject explores how the atmosphere and oceans determine many aspects of our lives. Questions such as what controls when and where it rains, the surf on a beach, ocean currents, seasonal snowfalls, and tropical cyclones will be explored. How the weather controls flooding and bushfire danger and why it is essential for water, energy and food security are discussed. Our health (heart attacks, allergies, respiratory and psychological wellbeing) is correlated with weather events. This subject will provide an introduction to understanding the weather and weather forecasting tools so important for the world we live in.

## Intended learning outcomes
On completion of this subject, students will have learnt to:
reflect as active global citizens sensitively and sustainably about how weather affects our environment, food, water and energy resources
describe the atmospheric and ocean structure and how it influences weather and climate of the Earth system
interpret weather maps and weather forecasts
explain atmospheric phenomena such as urban air pollution and extreme weather events such as heat waves and cyclones

## Generic skills
Students can expect to gain generic skills in:
demonstrate a high level of achievement in writing
reflect and critique information as life-long learners
demonstrate excellent organisational, planning and time management skills
apply knowledge and attitude to adapt to technological and social changes
