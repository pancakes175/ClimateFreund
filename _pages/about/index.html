My research interests include: the El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation and its related teleconnections, regimes influencing droughts and precipitation anomalies, advanced statistical and machine learning methods and their dynamical links, implications and applications.</p> <p><strong>Integrating Evidence Across Time Scales</strong> <br> My passion is to combine multiple lines of evidence (past proxy archives, observational data and future model simulation data) to gain new insights into current and future changes in climate. A strong seasonal focus of my work provides unprecedented opportunity to study climate-scale climate processes by contextualizing key climatic hazards such as droughts, rainfall extremes and recent trends and their dynamical links. Climate processes are evaluated by using a combination of observational data, seasonal forecasts such as ACCESS-S2, CMIP models, and statistical techniques to understand the current state of the climate, predict future changes, and assess the reliability of forecasts.</p> </body></html>
