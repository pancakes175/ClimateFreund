**My research integrates diverse evidence from various time scales, combining observations, paleoclimate data, and climate model simulations to unravel the complexities of the climate system.**

**Climate variability and changes**    
I am a Lecturer in Climate science who specialises in climate variability of the tropics and extra-tropics across seasonal to decadal time scales. My research interests include: the El Niño Southern Oscillation and its related teleconnections, regimes influencing droughts and precipitation anomalies, advanced statistical and machine learning methods and their dynamical links, implications and applications.

**Integrating Evidence Across Time Scales**                                          
My passion is to combine multiple lines of evidence (past proxy archives, observational data and future model simulation data) to gain new insights into current and future changes in climate. A strong seasonal focus of my work provides unprecedented opportunity to study climate-scale climate processes by contextualizing key climatic hazards such as droughts, rainfall extremes and recent trends and their dynamical links. Climate processes are evaluated by using a combination of observational data, seasonal forecasts such as ACCESS-S2, CMIP models, and statistical techniques to understand the current state of the climate, predict future changes, and assess the reliability of forecasts.
